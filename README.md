# ClassicBasic - Clone of Microsoft 8K BASIC

This version of BASIC is designed to implement most of a Microsoft 8K basic interpreter in C#. 
The initial aim is to get the code to be able to run the contents of "BASIC computer games" by David Ahl. 
See the games directory for the files from the book.

## Installing and running
Currently not sorted out yet, build from source is the current advice.
